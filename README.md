# Rykky-Photography

This is my first Git project and I'm trying to make a website with a better look than 
my local photography store...


I will be using for FRONT END:

-HTML5: usage of semantic tags and added accesibility for an easier navigation, iframes... 
-SASS: CSS3 preprocessor use of logic, variables , mixins, for a simpler and more maintainable web.
-JavaScript: interactivity, light box.


BACK END features that I want to include in the future with Node.js Mongo etc
  - Registration 
  - Online shop 
  - Orders control
